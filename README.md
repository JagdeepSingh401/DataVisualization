# DataVisualization-
Project to look at data for Go bike(Station based bike service) usage in a city 
The main goal in this project was to find trends with bike usage by users. The users were split into two different catagories; those who were subscribers and those who who paid for the service on the spot. 
After cleaning the data by removing duplicates and entry whic had 0 in them, I made some useful observation and translated those into Slides to be presented to the company in a simple and straight forward way.
