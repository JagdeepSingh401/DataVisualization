# DataVisualization-
Project to look at data for Go bike(Station based bike service) usage in a city 
The main goal in this project was to find trends with bike usage by users. The users were split into two different catagories; those who were subscribers and those who who paid for the service on the spot. 
After cleaning the data by removing duplicates and entry whic had 0 in them, I made some useful observation and translated those into Slides to be presented to the company in a simple and straight forward way.  


The plan to handle this project was to first make sure the data is complete and useable then asses the possible pieces of data which would tell the best story. After investigating and cleaning the data set I plotted some of the data to see if some trends could seen and imformation gained from them.
