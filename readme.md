# Ford go bikes dataset Exploration
## by Jagdeep Singh


## Dataset

The dataset contained information on 519700 trips taken using the go bikes for the year 2017. The data included in the dataset was information on users ages, start and end stations, the date data for each trip, duration of each trip and other bits of information.  


## Summary of Findings


In the exploration of this data set there where many interesting aspects of the data that jumped out. One of which was the dtat on locations,
by know where a trip started and where it ened you could see trends in use of the bikes. However the data for the station was overwhelming to plot in a meaningful way so step where taken to make the data more manageable by only selecting the most popular staions and using them to represent the trends.

Much information about the users could also be gained from the dataset, by looking at the users ages, thier genders and if they are subscribers or just customers habbits and trends can be seen. Opportunites to expand or further understand what type of user is most likely to use the service can also be gained by doing this. 

The data was not complete so it was neccessary to remove remedy this before moving on with exppolration. The major error for this data set was that it had missing values in the gender and age columns. So these need to be dropped to avoid errors when it came to the expolation of the data.   

## Key Insights for Presentation

The key insights gained for the presentation was which locations are the most popular for users and the information on users to see habbits and the key demographic. When looking at ages of users is was unclear to grasp the age range from a glanse and therefore the way the data was platted was changed to make is more obvious what ages use the bikes most. After making these changes it was clear that the majority of users are with in the ages of 30 to 50 years old. 

It was clear to see what stations were the most popular, San Francisco Caltrain with its two staions were the most popular by far and  there a assumption can be made that most journeys will start or end at this station. When looking at the user data further, men were the by far the most common user and subscribers made use out of the bike more often then random customers.
